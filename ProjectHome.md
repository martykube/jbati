## jBati ORM ##

jBati is a JavaScript library for Object Relational Mapping ([ORM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-relational_mapping)).  The API and configuration is modeled on [iBATIS](http://ibatis.apache.org/) and the targeted platform is [Jaxer](http://www.aptana.com/jaxer).

The jBati framework maps SQL statements you write to domain objects.  jBati is best suited for an existing DB schema, or when domain objects are backed by complex SQL querries.

jBati provides a simple to use and understand framework that exposes the full power of SQL and takes care of the repetitive coding of mapping result sets and query parameters to JavaScript values. To use the jBati framework, you write custom SQL for CRUD operations, define a mapping to objects, and the library takes care of marshaling and un-marshaling JavaScript objects.

### What's up with the name? ###

jBati is inspired by iBATIS, which is a successful project with a much larger stature than this new project; therefore less letters and less capital letters are used in the name (it's jBati instead of jBATIS).

The j in jBati might stand for JavaScript, Jaxer, or maybe even iBATIS junior.
